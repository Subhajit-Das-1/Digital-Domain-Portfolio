## 🚀 Why “Digital Domain”?

This portfolio lives online at *digital-domain-portfolio.vercel.app*—a domain that reflects my exploration of both digital and physical tech realms, such as web development and IoT.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a full portfolio from scratch with **only HTML, CSS, and JS**
- Structuring semantic, responsive content layouts with Flexbox and Grid
- Enhancing UI with **iconography, fonts, and scroll animations**
- Deploying instantly via **Vercel** using a vercel.app domain (just like many developers—custom domain not required) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
